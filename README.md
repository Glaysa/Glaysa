### Welcome to my GitHub

I don't know when it started, but as far as I can remember I was always and still am fascinated by technology. With technology, the possibilities are endless. As someone who started not knowing what I wanted to do for my future, getting into technology field, is something I am very pleased to have chosen as my career path.

- 📫 You can contact me at [glaysa.df@gmail.com](mailto:glaysa.df@gmail.com)
- 🌍 I'm based in Trondheim, Norway.
- 💡 **Fun fact**: What got me interested into programming was because of a game, but what really made me pursue it, was the very first html element 'h1' that I was able to display for the first time in my life that said "Hello World!" in the browser. I felt like everything fell into place and thought "Yes this is it!". 😎
- ⭐ **Tips**: I am no tech genius, but with hard work, perseverance and reliable colleagues (as well as good googling skills), no bug, errors or missing semicolon can stop you from deploying. 😈
