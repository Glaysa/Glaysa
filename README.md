### Welcome to my GitHub

I don't know when it started, but as far as I can remember I was always and still am fascinated by technology. With a simple click/tap of a button, you can order food, pay your bills, reserve rooms, and a lot more than one can imagine. As someone who started not knowing what I wanted to do for my future, getting into technology field, was something I am very pleased to have chosen as my career path.
