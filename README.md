### Hi there, here's a little something about me ...

I don't know when it started, but as far as I can remember I was always and still am fascinated by technology. With a simple click/tap of a button, you can order food, pay your bills, reserve rooms, and a lot more than one can imagine.

When I first created a website ... it wasn't even a website, just a simple webpage explaining what pixels are, what is the difference between a jpeg and a png. It wasn't that great. It was ugly to be precise, but during that time I was proud of it. It was just a couple lines of html tags and text, but to me it was something. I was intrigued. Then it hit me, what more could I create if I continued learning. Here am I today, studying IT and further improving my skills, by working on small personal projects.

I got into 3d modelling during my summer vacation, I tried learning the basics of Blender to create a clothing for my character in a game. It was fun. I feel like I don't have enough time to learn all the things I want. They're mostly computer related.

As someone who started not knowing what I wanted to do for my future, getting into technology field, was something I am very pleased to have chosen as my career path.
